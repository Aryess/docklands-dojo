###About Docklands Dojo
Docklands Dojo is the newest Dojo to open in Dublin region! Starting on Wednesday 18th at 6:00pm, Docklands Dojo will run every second Wednesday (1st April, 15th April, 29th April…) The Dojo is Championed by the CoderDojo Foundation team, the small team that support the CoderDojo movement globally. Mentors from local universities, businesses and startups volunteer their time to mentor at the Dojo.  The Dojo is supported by Bank of Ireland who will provide t-shirts and associated materials for the event, and the CHQ building who are donating the space for the Dojo.

###Why learn coding?
Websites, Video Games and Apps on mobiles are all created using code! There are many different types of coding languages in the world, but learning even the basics will give you the opportunity to build and create anything you can imagine!

###What will I learn if I attend?
Young people who attend the Docklands Dojo will learn a wide scope of coding languages but after learning the basics, each young person will create a project that interests them! This means that the young people who attend the Docklands Dojo could potentially make websites, apps, games, and much more. In addition to technology skills, young people also build complementary skills of creativity, innovation, communication, collaboration, teamwork and leadership.

###Who can attend?
Any young person aged between 7 - 17 can attend the Dojo. It is open to young people with prior coding experience and complete beginners alike. Young people under the age of 16 must have a parent or guardian attend and remain for the duration of the session.
